## Overview
### Description
Posting photos of an individual's pets and share them with others. Could be used to meet new friends with love for animals.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Share Pet Photos / Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile.
- **Story:** Analyzes user profile, and connects them to other users with similar profile information. The user can then befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how much they want to share.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on similar pet interests, then perhaps evolve into a social media application similar to Facebook. Large potential to use with Pinterest.
